## About
Chartridge is a self-hosted game analytic framework. It runs on your own server to provide simple, non-obtrusive analytics for your players.

Chartridge comes with a front-end for you to view your analytics from your browser. It is also easy enough to write your own front-ends for any system you need.

> ### Note
> This is an alpha release and is completely unsupported. It is honestly unlikely that I'll continue work on this in the future, though it is possible.  
> 
> There will be bugs, although from what I can tell, all of them are in the front-end code and the back-end works perfectly. I no longer use my own front-end for Chartridge after writing a plugin for [Mint](http://haveamint.com/).  
> 
> Once I'm happy with the code for that plugin, I'll release it.
